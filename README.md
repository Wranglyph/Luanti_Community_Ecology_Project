An attempt to make a casual voxel game with a fully simulated ecosystem. (I'll be using Luanti as the base engine.)

<summary>General Pitch</summary>

So basically, I want to make a FOSS game that will make normies want to play it even *before* they learn that it's free.
(It would be nice if I could enjoy it too- I actually find most games fairly boring.)
To do that, it should be fairly polished, and have significant novelty. 
There's tons of games out there whose sole purpose, effectively, is to let players *watch* some kind of sumlation unfold.
So surely, being able to walk around an interact with simulation would take it over the top, right? 
That simple premise is the heart of this game- most other elemens are just there to make the interaction fun and accesible.

Big thanks to Klei Wright, whose excellent [video essay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f21YJ5pjPog) is what ultimately inspired this project.
